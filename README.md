## Introduction

<p align= "justify" > This repository contains all the PCB files that I designed for the product Smart Batter. The machine was categorized into different sections to support modularity. Each section is completely modular and can be modified or replaced without impacting the other sections of the machine. Although, mechanically, the machine contains section A-F, the naming convention for the circuit boards were modified for convinience. All the PCB's were designed using Altium Designer. </p>

## PCB's
### Section D

<p align= "justify" > Section D is placed centrally in the machine and runs the operation from a Raspberry Pi 3B+ running AWS Greengrass IoT. The board also supports upto 8 Grove Touch Sensors, 3 Custom Switch Modules(designed in-house), 3 LED Modules, an RGB Module, YSF401 - Water Flow Sensor and a NEMA 14 Stepper Motor driven by A4988. </p>
